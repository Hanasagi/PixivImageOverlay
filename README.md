<h1>What does it do ?</h1>

Example are better than word, so check this [link](https://puu.sh/HvMVz/07dc2012a5.mp4) to see

<h1>How do you use it</h1>

First and foremost, ***download the app*** (no, really?)

Then, when you go to any pixiv artworks that has more than one image to load, the overlay will load itself.
To nagivate through all the images, you can either use **left click** (on each side of the image) or **arrow keys**.
You can also use the **left panel** and click on the image you want to load it.

To close the overlay, you can use **Echap** as well as the close button on the top right side, the other button can close the overlay if you wish. To reopen the overlay, simply use the orange button on the page.
